    <p>
        In order from simplest to most advanced, the four types of AI include reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.

        Reactive machines are able to perform basic operations based on some form of input. At this level of AI, no “learning” happens—the system is trained to do a particular task or set of tasks and never deviates from that. These are purely reactive machines that do not store inputs, have any ability to function outside of a particular context, or have the ability to evolve over time.

        Examples of reactive machines include most recommendation engines, IBM's Deep Blue chess AI, and Googles AlphaGo AI (arguably the best Go player in the world).

        Limited memory AI systems are able to store incoming data and data about any actions or decisions it makes, and then analyze that stored data in order to improve over time. This is where “machine learning” really begins, as limited memory is required in order for learning to happen.

        Since limited memory AIs are able to improve over time, these are the most advanced AIs we have developed to date. Examples include self-driving vehicles, virtual voice assistants and chatbots. 

        Theory of mind is the first of the two more advanced and (currently) theoretical types of AI that we haven't yet achieved. At this level, AIs would begin to understand human thoughts and emotions, and start to interact with us in a meaningful way. Here, the relationship between human and AI becomes reciprocal, rather than the simple one-way relationship humans have with various less advanced AIs now.

        The “theory of mind” terminology comes from psychology, and in this case refers to an AI understanding that humans have thoughts and emotions which then, in turn, affect the AI's behavior.

        Self-awareness is considered the ultimate goal for many AI developers, wherein AIs have human-level consciousness, aware of themselves as beings in the world with similar desires and emotions as humans. As yet, self-aware AIs are purely the stuff of science fiction.
